Alongside making your OSDs horizontal, there are lots of configuration options so you can customize OSDs as you want. Such as:
- Position, size, border-radius and hide timeout of osd window
- Size of icon, label and level bar
- border-radius of level bar
- Colors

Also you can write your custom CSS for all those elements.
